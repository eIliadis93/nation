This is the nation project I created.

Remember to change the DB creds on application.properties file in order to connect to the database with your cred.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/nation
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root

I used mariaDB as suggested.
